OK - An user creates a subscription and manages his/hers subscriptions.
OK - A subscription is "notify me on new content created that is tagged ..."
  (which includes both new content with interest tag, or old content that gets
  the interest tag),
  "notify me on any changes that affect content with interest tag".

OK - Do we want to offer a user the possibility to filter based on portal
  location or content type? I think these are too low level and even if a user
  gets extra emails, he can filter (maybe we express some specific info in
  mail subject such as “New Indicator created”)

OK - based on content rule(s), when a content item is edited (or published etc.)
  a ping (RabbitMQ) will be generated containing the url of edited object,
  the recorded action (edited, published etc.) and other needed info
  (tags, title, author, change of diff, date, etc.)

OK - Why a ping based on a content rule? The site administrator can decide for
  which content types this notification mechanism applies, thus applying
  a “sane default” for the users

WIP - an asynchronous script will process the pings (retrieve them from RabbitMQ)
  in order to send notification for all subscribed users in that case
  (tag + action).

OK - Global persistent utility that holds the catalog.
  https://community.plone.org/t/index-simple-data-in-a-custom-catalog/6911/3
    Result = catalog.query(tag=’education’, event=’created’)
    Result = [list of brains]
    Brain = userid, email address, etc.

OK - use memberdata to store user's preferences (tags, events)
OK - when a memberdata is updated -> the values reindexed in custom catalog

WIP - Based on the result processing, the async script extracts a list of user
  emails. It then triggers a new custom event (which will be processed by a
  content rule), to allow customization of notification mechanism.
  So, for example, if there are 20 users subscribed to a tag “water”,
  the async script will trigger the event for each one of these users and the
  content rule will then react to the event, sending a notification
  (email, slack message, etc).

TODO
- Add documentation on configuring ENV vars and running the notifications
  center script.
- content rules
- content actions / events as vocabulary
- custom events and notifications
- the user preferences form: use z3c.form, example: http://dpaste.com/1X2714Q
- NC -> notify custom event (a custom content rule will send email:
  editable template using custom substitution variables) instead of sending
  emails

- Create documentation based on this:
Usage:
  User: manage subscriptions using /user_preferences form
  Admin:
    In Site Setup - Content rules:
      Add content rule
        Title: EEA Notifications: ping RabbitMQ on added content
        Description: EEA Notifications: ping RabbitMQ on added content
        Triggering event: Object added to this container
          Save
          Add action:
            Ping RMQ
              Related actions: added created
              Notification subject: Content created
              Notifications action: added
          Apply rule on the whole site
        Analog for other events: edit, delete etc.

Tests:
Add in buildout.cfg:
parts +=
    test

[test]
recipe = zc.recipe.testrunner
defaults = ['--auto-color', '--auto-progress']
eggs =
    eea.notifications [test]
    plone.testing [test]
    plone.app.testing [test]

Run the tests using:
./bin/test -s eea.notifications

RabbitMQ Client Settings: (/@@rabbitmq-client-controlpanel)
Example:
  Server Address: 172.26.0.2
    Get if from:
    $ docker inspect 8b51d27e0306 | grep "IPAddress"                                                                                    4016ms  Mon 27 Aug 2018 12:08:18 PM EEST
            "SecondaryIPAddresses": null,
            "IPAddress": "",
                    "IPAddress": "172.26.0.2"

    Instead of 8b51d27e0306 you will use the ID of rabbitmq docker container.
  Server port: 5,672
  Username: guest
  Password: guest

For testing mails (dev):
Add in your docker-compose:
  postfix:
    image: eaudeweb/mailtrap
    ports:
      - "8081:80"

then http://localhost:8081 u: mailtrap p: mailtrap
