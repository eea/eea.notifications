- An user creates a subscription and manages his/hers subscriptions.
- A subscription is "notify me on new content created that is tagged ..."
  (which includes both new content with interest tag, or old content that gets
  the interest tag),
  "notify me on any changes that affect content with interest tag".

- Do we want to offer a user the possibility to filter based on portal
  location or content type? I think these are too low level and even if a user
  gets extra emails, he can filter (maybe we express some specific info in
  mail subject such as “New Indicator created”)

- based on content rule(s), when a content item is edited (or published etc.)
  a ping (RabbitMQ) will be generated containing the url of edited object,
  the recorded action (edited, published etc.) and other needed info
  (tags, title, author, change of diff, date, etc.)

- Why a ping based on a content rule? The site administrator can decide for
  which content types this notification mechanism applies, thus applying
  a “sane default” for the users

- an asynchronous script will process the pings (retrieve them from RabbitMQ)
  in order to send notification for all subscribed users in that case
  (tag + action).

- Global persistent utility that holds the catalog.
    Result = catalog.query(tag=’education’, event=’created’)
    Result = [list of brains]
    Brain = userid, email address, etc.

- use memberdata to store user's preferences (tags, events)
- when a memberdata is updated -> the values reindexed in custom catalog

- Based on the result processing, the async script extracts a list of user
  emails. It then triggers a new custom event (which will be processed by a
  content rule), to allow customization of notification mechanism.
  So, for example, if there are 20 users subscribed to a tag “water”,
  the async script will trigger the event for each one of these users and the
  content rule will then react to the event, sending a notification
  (email, slack message, etc).

TODO
- Add LICENSE file.
- Add documentation on configuring ENV vars and running the notifications
  center script.
- catalog configuration (evolve101)
